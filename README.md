# E-Commerce-Back-End

For this project, I created an application that allows inputting, getting, and deleting data that is stored at the back end of a sample e-commerce website. I created a mysql database in which I can modify its contents by opening various api routes in Insomnia. GET API routes will filter and display data. POST routes allow users to create and input new data into the database. While PUT routes and DELETE routes allows updating or removing existing data. Here is a link to a walkthrough video of my application: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EUsrXt3j7u2X19LNLsi9UpXGF7dJ1CeP/view
